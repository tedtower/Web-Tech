				<article>
					<p>The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, was invented by Tim-Berners Lee at CERN in 1989.
					The original purpose of the web was to provide automatic information-sharing between scientists around the world.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is a space for information resources that are uniquely identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) 
					or Uniform Resource Locators (URL) that can be accessed via the internet. 
					These resources are linked to other web resources with the use of hyperlinks or hypermedia links.	
					</p>
					<p>Web resources are specially formatted documents which, today, can contain multimedia files. 
					This documents are formatted with the use of HTML and with the help of CSS. 
					Web resources can be viewed via a Web Browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome).

                    <h4>HTTP</h4>
                    <article>
                        <p>HTTP is an abbreviation of HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents like HTML. It runs in a client-server computing model where the client requests for a specific web content and the server provides it. Moreover, it defines the procedures and rules that the client and server follows for transmitting information resources.

                    <article>
                        <h5>HTTP/ 0.9</h5>
                        <p>The initial version of the HTTP. Client requests consist only of a single request line (&#60;Request Method&#62; &#60;path of the document&#62;). It supports only the GET method for retrieving web resources. The web resources supported in this version are HTML files only. Lastly the TCP/IP connection between the server and the client is terminated immediately after the document has been transmitted. 
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h5>HTTP/ 1.0</h5>
                        <p>Added support to header fields for request and response headers (e.g. HTTP version number, Status Code, Content-type) which allows the transmission of not only HTML files but also of scripts, stylesheets, and Multimedia content. This version of HTTP also allowed support for the HEAD and POST methods.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h5>HTTP/ 1.1</h5>
                        <p>This standardized protocol was published in early 1997. It introduced many improvements from the past version. Persistent connections (Keep-Alive), pipelining, content negotiation, etc. There were also new methods supported in this version, namely, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and OPTIONS.
                        </p>

                    <article>
                        <h5>HTTP/ 2.0</h5>
                        <p>The latest version of HTTP. The specifications for this version was published in May 2015 by the IETF. The primary goals for this version are to minimize protocol overhead, reduce latency by multiplexing, and add support for server push and request prioritization.
