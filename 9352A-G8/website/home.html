				<header><h2>WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW)</h2></header>
				<article>
					<p>The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, was invented by Tim-Berners Lee at CERN in 1989.
					The original purpose of the web was to provide automatic information-sharing between scientists around the world.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is a space for information resources that are uniquely identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) 
					or Uniform Resource Locators (URL) that can be accessed via the internet. 
					These resources are linked to other web resources with the use of hyperlinks or hypermedia links.	
					</p>
					<p>Web resources are specially formatted documents which, today, can contain multimedia files. 
					This documents are formatted with the use of HTML and with the help of CSS. 
					Web resources can be viewed via a Web Browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome).

                    <h3>HTTP</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>HTTP is an abbreviation of HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents like HTML. It runs in a client-server computing model where the client requests for a specific web content and the server provides it. Moreover, it defines the procedures and rules that the client and server follows for transmitting information resources.
                        </p>

                    <div><h3>HTTP Versions</h3></div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>HTTP/ 0.9</h4>
                        <p>The initial version of the HTTP. Client requests consist only of a single request line (&#60;Request Method&#62; &#60;path of the document&#62;). It supports only the GET method for retrieving web resources. The web resources supported in this version are HTML files only. Lastly the TCP/IP connection between the server and the client is terminated immediately after the document has been transmitted. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>HTTP/ 1.0</h4>
                        <p>Added support to header fields for request and response headers (e.g. HTTP version number, Status Code, Content-type) which allows the transmission of not only HTML files but also of scripts, stylesheets, and Multimedia content. This version of HTTP also allowed support for the HEAD and POST methods.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>HTTP/ 1.1</h4>
                        <p>This standardized protocol was published in early 1997. It introduced many improvements from the past version. Persistent connections (Keep-Alive), pipelining, content negotiation, etc. There were also new methods supported in this version, namely, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and OPTIONS.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>HTTP/ 2.0</h4>
                        <p>The latest version of HTTP. The specifications for this version was published in May 2015 by the IETF. The primary goals for this version are to minimize protocol overhead, reduce latency by multiplexing, and add support for server push and request prioritization.

                                <p>HTTP has a set of methods to signify the actions being done on resources. HTTP methods are also called as “HTTP verbs”. Each of the methods have different actions and some of them are similar.
                                </p>

                                <h4>GET</h4>
                                <p>This method is used to redeem or read a representation of resources. If the method successfully retrieve, the method returns a representation in XML, JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). GET corresponds to Read in CRUD operations.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>HEAD</h4>
                                <p>This method is similar to GET method but without its message-body in response. This method is used to retrieve only meta-information in response headers. This method is useful for verifying link availability.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>POST</h4>
                                <p>This is method is used for sending data/resource to the API server. The method will request for the server to accept datum/data from the client. Upon successful appliance, it will return HTTP code 200 (OK) for updating and 201 (CREATED) for creating. Otherwise, if there are errors concerning posting, it will return HTTP code like 204 (NO CONTENT).</p>
                                <p>Submitting a contact form is one of the simplest example. When a user fills out inputs in a form and hit send. The inputs will be added in the response body of post request and it will be sent to the server.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>PUT</h4>
                                <p>This method is used to create or update resources from the client to the API server. Moreover, the method is to URI containing the value of non-existent resource ID. Upon successful request, it will return HTTP codes like 200 (OK) for updating and 201 (CREATED) for creating. Otherwise, if there are errors with regards to understanding or implementing, it will return HTTP code like 501 (NOT IMPLEMENTED).</p>

                                <h4>DELETE</h4>
                                <p>This method is simply to delete a resource/resources identified by a URI. Upon successful deletion of resource, it will return HTTP code like 200 (OK) with a response body. Otherwise, HTTP code like 204 (NO CONTENT) will be returned if there are no response body. If the request is for a non-existent resource, it will return HTTP code like 404 (NOT FOUND).</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>PATCH</h4>
                                <p>This method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource. Moreover, the request only needs the changes contained to a resource. PATCH is similar to PUT but the request body contains a set of instructions that tells how the resource to be modified to produce a new version. </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>TRACE</h4>
                                <p>This method is for the client to see things that are being received and the data is used for testing and diagnosing. The request reflects back the message from client to the server and returns back HTTP code like 200 (OK).</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h4>OPTIONS</h4>
                                <p>This method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.</p>

                                    <p>&#45; Are considered safe when their request semantics are read-only. This means that there should be no change of state to the server.</p>
                                    <p>&#45; The methods considered safe are the GET, HEAD, TRACE, and OPTIONS methods.</p>

                                    <h4>Idempotent Methods</h4>
                                    <p>&#45; If multiple identical requests are sent to the server, the effect will be the same as the first issuance of such request.</p>
                                    <p>&#45; -	The methods considered idempotent are the PUT, DELETE, and the safe request methods.</p>

                                    <p>&#45; As the term implies, request methods are termed to be cacheable if server responses to those requests are allowed to be stored for reuse.</p>
                                    <p>&#45; Only the GET, HEAD, and POST methods are cacheable.</p>
