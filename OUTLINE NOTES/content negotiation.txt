Content Negotiation
Since not all users have the same preferences of how elements should be presented, content negotiation is basically the process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations available. Any response that has an entity-body may be subjected to content negotiation, including error responses.

	A. Server-driven Content Negotiation
			Selection of the best representation for a response which is made by an algorithm located at the server. It is advantageous when the server wants to better explain to the user agent the description of the process of selecting the available representations and the "best guess" it recommends.
			
			Some Disadvantages:
				1. The server can't accurately determine the "best" representation for a response for a certain user.
				2.The process wherein the user agent describe its capabilities in each request can be inefficient and can 
				be an act of violation to user's privacy.
				

				
	B. Agent-driven Negotiation
			Performed by the user agent wherein the selection of the best representation for a response after receiving an initial response from the origin server is done. Selection of the representations may be performed either manually or automatically by the user. It is advantageous when the origin server can't determine the user capabilities from examining the request.
			
			

	C. Transparent Negotiation
			A combination of both server-driven and agent-driven negotiation. It has the advantage of distributing the negotiation work that would otherwise be required of the origin server
