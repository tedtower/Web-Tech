<p>When a user interacts with a browser window, an event occurs. JavaScript functions can be assigned to handle what happens when a page loads, a user clicks a button, when the browser screen changes, and other events.

	For JavaScript to work with these events, different methods are used. HTML event attributes support direct execution of JavaScript code and calling of JavaScript functions. Event handler functions can be assigned to HTML elements and you can also hinder events from being sent or handled.

	Event handlers are convenient because it deals with and manages actions and input of a user, and of the browser. It deals with actions that should be done when a page loads or when a page closes. It prompts what should happen when a button is clicked and verifies content when user input is needed.</p>

<p>Syntax
	element.event = function;

	Where element is a page element, event is the name of the event, and function is the function that will specify what will occur when the event happens. </p>
